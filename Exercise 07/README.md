  <p align="center">
<b>VM Translator I â€“ Arithmetic Commands</b> is the seventh assignment I completed in the <b>From Nand to Tetris</b> course at HUJI.
<br>
In this exercise, I developed the first part of a Virtual Machine translator that converts arithmetic and stack-based VM commands into Hack assembly code. The project focused on implementing operations such as `add`, `sub`, `neg`, `eq`, `lt`, and `gt`, as well as memory access commands like `push` and `pop`.
<br>
This assignment deepened my understanding of stack-based virtual machines and the translation pipeline that bridges high-level abstractions with low-level execution.
