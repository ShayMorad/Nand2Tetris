  <p align="center">
<b>Boolean Logic</b> is the first assignment I completed in the <b>From Nand to Tetris</b> course at HUJI.
<br>
In this foundational exercise, I implemented basic logic gates (such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, etc.) using only the primitive NAND gate. The goal was to understand how all digital logic can be built from a single universal gate.
<br>
This low-level, hardware-centric introduction laid the groundwork for constructing more advanced circuits in later stages of the course.
