  <p align="center">
<b>Hack Computer â€“ Building a Computer</b> is the fifth assignment I completed in the <b>From Nand to Tetris</b> course at HUJI.
<br>
In this project, I designed and implemented the complete architecture of the Hack computer using only previously built logic chips. This includes the ALU, registers, memory, and control logic required to execute machine-level instructions.
<br>
The exercise offers a hands-on understanding of how a real computer is constructed from the ground up, translating theoretical logic into a working hardware platform capable of running programs.
