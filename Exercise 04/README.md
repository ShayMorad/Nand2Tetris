  <p align="center">
<b>Machine Language</b> is the fourth assignment I completed in the <b>From Nand to Tetris</b> course at HUJI.
<br>
This exercise introduced the low-level machine language used throughout the Nand2Tetris project. I learned to write programs directly in binary instructions tailored for the Hack platform, focusing on arithmetic operations, control flow, and memory access.
<br>
This foundational understanding bridges the gap between high-level code and hardware execution, setting the stage for building an assembler and virtual machine in later assignments.
