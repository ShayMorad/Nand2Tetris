# üìò HUJI ‚Äì Nand to Tetris

This repository contains my personal solutions to the From Nand to Tetris course assignments, part of the Computer Science program at The [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/).

Spanning across 13 intensive weeks, this course covers the full construction of a working computer system‚Äîstarting from basic logic gates and ending with a custom high-level programming language and operating system. Along the way, we built essential components like an assembler, virtual machine translator, compiler, and OS libraries.
